Description
===========

This is a special YaST module that allows users to configure pre-installed
systems to match their needs, e.g., language, network settings, root password,
etc.

See:

- [YaST Firstboot][oswiki] on the openSUSE wiki
- [Deploying Customized Preinstallations][slesdoc] in the SLES15-SP4 Deployment Guide

[oswiki]: https://en.opensuse.org/YaST_Firstboot
[slesdoc]: https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-deployment-firstboot.html

The workflow is defined in a
[control file](control/firstboot.xml),
which uses the same format as the
[Installer control file](https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/blob/master/doc/control-file.md).
The default control file can be found in
[control directory](control).

More subject-specific pieces of information can be found in the [doc](doc)
directory.

Development
===========

This module is developed as part of YaST. See the
[development documentation](http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/).

Getting the Sources
===================

Testing Environment
===================

##To test your first-boot workflow

1. Install yast2-firstboot package from media or directly from sources at GitHub
2. Copy your firstboot control file to /etc/YaST2/firstboot.xml
3. Enable first boot at startup `sudo systemctl enable YaST2-Firstboot.service`
4. Make sure this file exists `sudo touch /var/lib/YaST2/reconfig_system`
5. Reboot the system
6. While booting again, YaST2-Firstboot service checks for existence of
   /var/lib/YaST2/reconfig_system and starts the configuration workflow
